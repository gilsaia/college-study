PostgreSQL

    Develop Performance Farm Database and Website (2019)
    Project Description
    The PostgreSQL Performance Farm project is a community project to collect performance data from tests as code changes are made to PostgreSQL. To support this effort, a database needs to be created for storing results, and a Web site developed to review results. This project will focus on developing the Web site on top of the database.

    The database will be using PostgreSQL in the back-end. Test results will come in the form of JSON and flat files. The Web application will be developed using the Django Web framework.

    For reference, the code that will be supplying test results is https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pgperffarm.git;a=summary.

    As an example, the PostgreSQL Build Farm site [1] is a central repository for the results of testing source code changes for PostgreSQL as they occur, on a wide variety of platforms.
